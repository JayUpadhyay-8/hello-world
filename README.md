# hello-world
Hey, I'm Kunal just started to learn python,and know a bit about java object oriented programming..And lastly I'm a gamer, i just love to play games all the time, completed almost all singleplayer games and some I played twice or thrice, and if you're reading this you're the best.

If you want to start with python first code try this
print("Hello World ...")
